#  Narwhal Simulator Plan
The plan for the game goes here.
## Overall
Narwhal Simulator is a top-down narwhal "simulation" game where the player kills creatures, mines minerals, and purchases upgrades to become more powerful. The game consists of several areas of increasing difficulty, each with different creatures and new environments, each with a unique boss, a very powerful creature that must be defeated to access the most powerful items and areas.
## Gameplay
The gameplay loop consists of exploring, acquiring materials and score (by killing creatures and mining), and fighting the boss.

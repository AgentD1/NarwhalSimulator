#  Narwhal Simulator Plan
The plan for Narwhal Simulator. This will be constantly updated during development.
## Overview
Narwhal Simulator is a top-down narwhal "simulation" game where the player kills creatures, mines minerals, and purchases upgrades to become more powerful. The game consists of several areas of increasing difficulty, each with different creatures and new environments, each with a unique boss, a very powerful creature that must be defeated to access the most powerful items and areas.
## The Name
Why Narwhal Simulator? Well it's funny. Upon playing the game, anyone would realise that it is indeed not an accurate simulation of the life of a narwhal. The name is inspired from games like Goat Simulator. If you've ever played Goat Simulator, you would know that it is almost the least accurate possible "simulation" of a goat. I'm not attached to the name, so if anyone can come up with something cooler than Narwhal Simualtor then I might change it.
## Narwhals
Narwhals are super cool. The basis for everything that will be fun about Narwhal Simulator is your character's species. Every male narwhal (and 15% of female narwhals) have a long protruding tusk (not a horn, those are for unicorns) and it is currently unknown what these are actually used for. Scientists have suggested many plausible things, like for breaking ice or as a sensory organ. Some have suggested that they use it as a weapon; that is what your narwhal in game will use it for because that is by far the coolest possible use for it.
## Genre
Narwhal Simulator is closest to an Action game. Narwhal Simulator is an Action game because the player must fight creatures to acquire the upgrades necessary to progress. I considered putting it into Action-Adventure instead, but I expect a lot more of the player's time will be spent fighting things than exploring, though if I put enough effort into the world design, this might be subject to change.
## Target Audience
I feel a wide range of people will be able to have fun with this game. I think Narwhal Simulator would most appeal to gamers from around 12 and up.
## Gameplay
The gameplay loop consists of exploring, acquiring materials and score (by killing creatures and mining), and fighting the boss, then upgrading yourself with the new materials you find.
## Movement
Movement is a very important part of the Narwhal Simulator experience, as mastering the movement system is likely to be the major way players will get better at the game. Movement should be easy for beginners to start using, but include aspects that must be mastered with time and effort. The basic idea of the movement consists of moving forwards and backwards and rotating left and right. Players will quickly unlock upgrades which allow them to temporarily boost their speed (kinda like sprinting but underwater) and moving left and right without rotating. These should allow players to become proficient at controlling their narwhal and using it effectively.
## Mechanics
The main source of damage from the player will be the tusk. Hitting something with the tip of the tuskwill do an amount of damage proportional to the speed and how upgraded the tusk is. Some upgrades may grant the ability to damage enemies in other ways, but the tusk will likely remain the main damage-dealer throughout the game.
## Options
The game will have different difficulty settings that can be set at the start or during a playthrough. These effect the player's health and damage dealt, the spawn rate of hostile creatures, and the difficulty of bosses. There will be 4 levels of difficulty, Easy (for players who aren't very good at video games, or for players who value the exploration aspect more than the combat aspect), Normal (the recommended setting for new players and the default setting for new playthroughs), Hard (a good setting for people who aren't finding normal challenging enough), and Expert (for experienced players looking for a challenge). There may be some other modes included like an Ironman/Hardcore mode (where reloading saves is illegal and death is permanent).
## Map
The game's map will be a very important aspect of the game, since exploration is a major part of the game. The map will be a combination of procedurally-generated and prebuilt as to make replaying the game interesting while keeping the most crucial parts of the map (like boss areas) as good as possible. The map will consist of multiple areas or "biomes", each of which consisting of a different selection of creatures and materials. Each area will pose its own challenges, with more difficult enemies and stronger materials, thus forcing the player to upgrade in order to continue to be powerful.
## Progressively Rising Difficulty
As you go through the game and go to higher-difficulty areas, you will encounter enemies that are more difficult. Many games fall into a pattern where the higher-difficulty creatures are just reskinned versions of the easier ones with higher health and damage. I don't want Narwhal Simulator to work like that because it's boring and advancing feels lame and worthless. I want enemies as the area gets more difficult to not only increase in health and damage (to force the player to get stronger upgrades) but also have more complex and interesting behaviour, hopefully leading to a more interesting experience fighting them (and thus forcing the player to get better at the game and using the different mechanics). 
## Story
I don't yet have a story in mind. I don't think this game will be especially story-based, with the story being basic and just serving as a reason for your actions. The story will likely consist of a reason to get to the most difficult area. There will definitely be a final boss and it will hopefully be extremely cool. We can figure out what that will be when the game actually functions.
## HUD
The HUD will have your health, any charging currently going on (e.g. charging your "sprint"), and the number of points/narwhal coins/materials you have. The HUD will be sparse to allow the player a better view of their surroudings and to not overwhelm the player with unnecessary information.
